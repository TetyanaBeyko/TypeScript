# Tagname depends on the type of change. Possible tag names - chore, hotfix, patch, minor, major. 
# The smallest changes, mostly refactoring, functions renaming, small optimisations, adding tests, etc - can and should be called the chore. The chore does not update the version. 
# The small fixes in functionality/ci/build that require the build version should be called hotfix. 
# The functionality implementation, the feature developed, the change that does not change the interfaces and API should be called ->  patch.
# The flow change, the infrastructure change, a feature that adds something significantly new, etc -> should be called minor.
# The change of approach, a full change of API and/or underlying logic, etc -> should be called major.
